# Getting started

### Prerequisites

Before you get started, there are a few prerequisites to consider. Ensure that your development environment meets the following requirements:

* **Rust:** Since `era-test-node` is written in Rust, you need to have Rust installed on your machine. You can download Rust from [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
* **Other Dependencies:** This crate relies on `rocksDB` for its operation. If you encounter any compile errors due to `rocksDB`, you might also need to install some dependencies with the following command: `apt-get install -y cmake pkg-config libssl-dev clang`.

After checking all these prerequisites, you should be ready to use the `era-test-node`. Please keep in mind that `era-test-node` is still in its **alpha** stage, so some features might not be fully supported yet.

When utilizing `era-test-node` with MetaMask, it's essential to note that any restart of the in-memory node will necessitate a reset of MetaMask's cached account data (nonce, etc). To do this, navigate to 'Settings', then 'Advanced', and finally, select 'Clear activity tab data'.
